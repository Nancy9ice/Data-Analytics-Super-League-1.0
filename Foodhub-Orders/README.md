# Foodhub Orders

## Introduction
Open the [notebook file](https://github.com/Nancy9ice/Foodhub-Orders/blob/main/Foodhub%20Orders.ipynb) with VSCode or Jupyter Notebook and answer the questions there. Use the [csv file](https://github.com/Nancy9ice/Foodhub-Orders/blob/main/foodhub-order.csv) given as the data to analyze.

Below are the following questions that were answered in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Nancy9ice/Foodhub-Orders/blob/main/Foodhub%20Orders.ipynb):

- How many rows and columns are present in the data?

- What are the datatypes of the different columns in the dataset?

- Are there any missing values in the data?

- Check the statistical summary of the data. What is the minimum, average, and maximum time it takes for food to be prepared once an order is placed? 

- How many orders are not rated? 

- Explore all the variables and provide observations on their distributions.

-  Which are the top 5 restaurants in terms of the number of orders received? 

- Which is the most popular cuisine on weekends?

- What percentage of the orders cost more than 20 dollars?

- What is the mean order delivery time?

- The company has decided to give 20% discount vouchers to the top 3 most frequent customers. Find the IDs of these customers and the number of orders they placed.

- Perform a multivariate analysis to explore relationships between the important variables in the dataset.

- The company wants to provide a promotional offer in the advertisement of the restaurants. The condition to get the offer is that the restaurants must have a rating count of more than 50 and the average rating should be greater than 4. Find the restaurants fulfilling the criteria to get the promotional offer.

- The company charges the restaurant 25% on the orders having cost greater than 20 dollars and 15% on the orders having cost greater than 5 dollars. Find the net revenue generated by the company across all orders.

- The company wants to analyze the total time required to deliver the food. What percentage of orders take more than 60 minutes to get delivered from the time the order is placed? (The food has to be prepared and then delivered.)

- The company wants to analyze the delivery time of the orders on weekdays and weekends. How does the mean delivery time vary during weekdays and weekends?

## Conclusion

- Many customers prefer specific restaurants than the other

- This restaurant preference could be based on the nature of the cuisine since restaurants are specialized in specific cuisine types

- Orders are higher during weekends than weekdays

- Shake Shack, Meatball Shop, Blue Ribbon Sushi, and Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken are consistent in terms of top restaurants with most orders and top ratings. 

- American, Japanese, Italian and Chinese cuisine types are the most ordered

- Most customers don't give ratings to the foods they order

## Recommendations

- Enhance Restaurant Selection: Based on the finding that many customers prefer specific restaurants over others, ensure that the app offers a wide selection of popular and highly rated restaurants. 

- Optimize Delivery Experience: Since orders are higher during weekends, optimize the delivery operations to handle the increased demand effectively. Ensure that there are sufficient delivery partners and resources available to maintain timely deliveries. Consider offering delivery promotions or incentives during weekends to encourage more orders and retain customer loyalty.

- Strengthen Partnerships with Top Restaurants: Collaborate closely with the consistently popular and highly rated restaurants mentioned in the findings, such as Shake Shack, Meatball Shop, Blue Ribbon Sushi, and Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken. Build strong partnerships with these restaurants to ensure a seamless ordering and delivery experience for customers. Work closely with them to streamline order processing, optimize packaging, and maintain food quality during delivery.

- Loyalty Programs and Special Offers: Implement a loyalty program to incentivize repeat orders and customer retention. Offer exclusive discounts, rewards, or freebies to customers who frequently order through the app. Collaborate with partner restaurants to create special offers or promotions that are exclusive to the platform, providing additional value to customers.

- In-App Reminders: Send gentle reminders to customers after they have received their food delivery, encouraging them to provide feedback and rate their experience. These reminders can be in the form of push notifications or emails, prompting customers to share their thoughts and ratings.

- Engaging and Interactive Feedback Forms: Make the rating process more engaging by using interactive feedback forms. Include elements such as emojis, sliders, or comment boxes that allow customers to express their opinions and experiences in a more interactive manner. This can increase the likelihood of customers leaving ratings.
