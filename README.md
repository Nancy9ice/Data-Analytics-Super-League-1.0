# Data Analytics Super League 1.0

In this project, I showcased my skills in data cleaning, data visualization, SQL, A/B testing, and ML model building (precisely customer segmentation model).

On June 9, 2023, I was announced the winner of the Data Analytics Super League 1.0 hosted by Lighthall.

This data competition comprised of 5 challenges where passing the current challenge was essential to moving to the next challenge phase. 

The first challenge was about providing a simple Microsoft Excel function which I won't be showing here. However, I'll be guiding you through the 4 other challenges that I worked on that landed me at the finals and as the winner. 

Take note that some of these projects were modified a little bit after the challenge to make it more impactful.

Listed below are the 4 challenges which are linked to their respective directories:
